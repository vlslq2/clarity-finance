# Analysis of the Budget and Pocket Data Loading Issues

This document outlines the root causes of the issues that prevented budgets and pockets from appearing in the application, and the steps taken to resolve them.

## The Core Problem: A Cascade of Hidden Errors

The primary issue was a series of subtle, interconnected problems in the database schema and data access logic. Each problem masked the next, making the root cause difficult to identify.

### Issue 1: Incorrect Join in `get_budget_summaries` Function

*   **Symptom:** Budgets were not appearing in the application.
*   **Root Cause:** An early version of the `get_budget_summaries` function was attempting to join the `budgets` and `categories` tables by casting their `uuid` and `bigint` primary keys to `text`. This incorrect join logic caused the function to fail silently and return no data.
*   **Solution:** We created a new migration ([`20250806130000_recreate_budget_summary_function_correctly.sql`](supabase/migrations/20250806130000_recreate_budget_summary_function_correctly.sql:1)) that defines the function with the correct, direct `uuid`-to-`uuid` joins.

### Issue 2: Missing Foreign Key on `recurring_transactions`

*   **Symptom:** After fixing the budgets, pockets were still not appearing.
*   **Root Cause:** The `useData` hook fetches data sequentially. The query to fetch `recurring_transactions` was failing because there was no foreign key relationship defined between `recurring_transactions` and `categories`. This error stopped the `loadData` function before it could even attempt to fetch the pockets.
*   **Solution:** We created a new migration ([`20250806170500_add_fk_to_recurring_transactions.sql`](supabase/migrations/20250806170500_add_fk_to_recurring_transactions.sql:1)) to add the missing foreign key constraint.

### Issue 3: Data Type Mismatch for `pockets.id`

*   **Symptom:** Even if the recurring transactions error was not present, the pockets would not have appeared.
*   **Root Cause:** The `pockets.id` column in the database is a `bigint`, but the `Pocket.id` type in the frontend was defined as a `string`. This mismatch would cause a silent failure when the application tried to process the pocket data.
*   **Solution:** We updated the `useData` hook to correctly format the pocket data, converting the numeric `id` to a string before dispatching it to the application's state.

### Issue 4: Pocket Balances Not Updating

*   **Symptom:** After fixing the data loading issues, pocket balances were not updating when new transactions were added.
*   **Root Cause:** There was no database trigger to automatically update the pocket balance when a transaction was created, updated, or deleted.
*   **Solution:** We created a new migration ([`20250806171500_add_trigger_to_update_pocket_balance.sql`](supabase/migrations/20250806171500_add_trigger_to_update_pocket_balance.sql:1)) that adds a trigger to the `transactions` table. This trigger executes a function that correctly adjusts the pocket balance for any `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation.

## How the `get_budget_summaries` Function Works Correctly

The final, correct version of the `get_budget_summaries` function is defined in the [`20250806130000_recreate_budget_summary_function_correctly.sql`](supabase/migrations/20250806130000_recreate_budget_summary_function_correctly.sql:1) migration. Here is a breakdown of why it works:

1.  **Consistent Data Types:** The function correctly joins `budgets`, `categories`, and a subquery of `transactions` (`monthly_expenses`) using their shared `category_id` of type `uuid`. There is no incorrect casting.
2.  **Subquery for Aggregation:** It uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `monthly_expenses` to calculate the total spent for each category within the current month. This is an efficient way to pre-calculate the spent amount.
3.  **Robust Joins:** It uses `LEFT JOIN` to ensure that a budget is still returned even if it has no associated transactions for the month. The `COALESCE` function is used to handle these cases, defaulting the `spent_amount` to `0`.

This corrected function, combined with the fix for the `recurring_transactions` foreign key, resolves the core issues and ensures that all data can be loaded correctly.
### Issue 5: Pocket Balances Doubling on Update

*   **Symptom:** After fixing the trigger, editing a transaction caused the pocket balance to double, and deleting it only halved the value.
*   **Root Cause:** The trigger logic for `UPDATE` operations was flawed. It was reversing the old transaction and then applying the new one, which resulted in double-counting when only the description was changed.
*   **Solution:** We created a final migration ([`20250807061500_correct_pocket_balance_trigger.sql`](supabase/migrations/20250807061500_correct_pocket_balance_trigger.sql:1)) that replaces the trigger function with corrected logic. The new function correctly calculates the *difference* between the old and new transaction amounts and applies only that difference to the pocket balance, which resolves the doubling issue.
